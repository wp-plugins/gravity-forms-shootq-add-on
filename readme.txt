== Description ==
Photographers, your wait is over! The Gravity Forms ShootQ add-on utilizes the awesome capabilities of [Gravity Forms](http://beauti.us/GForms) to collect **any information you desire** and send it your [ShootQ](http://www.shootq.com) account as a new lead. It's easy to use, very flexible, and only attaches to the form or forms you need to use.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the extracted archive to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Open the plugin settings page Gravity Forms -> Settings -> ShootQ
4. Add your ShootQ API Key and Brand Abbreviation
5. Add a "feed" to map the ShootQ fields to your form
4. Start generating leads!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I have more than one brand set up in ShootQ. Will this let me use both? =
Sorry, but no. This is a one brand pony show. The majority of people who have multiple ShootQ brands will also have separate domains for each brand. There are no plans at this time to change the plugin to allow multiple brands per installation.

= Does this work on a multisite installation of WordPress? =
This plugin has *not* been tested on a multi-site installation, so I can't tell you. Let me know if you find out!

= Where can I get help on getting this thing started? =
Visit my [Usage & Installation Instructions](http://www.pussycatintimates.com/gravity-forms-shootq-add-on/) page for plenty of assistance on getting everything configured to start collecting leads for ShootQ.

== Screenshots ==
1. Create a Gravity Form to use and map the ShootQ fields with those in your form.
2. Your visitor submits the form and *voila!* Everything gets sent to ShootQ!
